This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of disease outbreaks in Nigeria across various states, genders, and age groups. The aim is to uncover insights into disease patterns, identify the most affected demographics, and provide recommendations for targeted public health responses.

Project Objective
To analyze patterns in disease outbreaks across Nigerian states by exploring key metrics such as:

Disease type and prevalence

Gender and age group distribution

Trends over time

Survival status of patients

This helps inform public health policy, resource allocation, and preventive strategies for government and health agencies.

Dashboard Insights
State-Level Impact
Niger State had the highest outbreak, followed by Ondo, Kano, Bayelsa, and Imo.

Disease outbreaks are not region-specific — affecting both Northern and Southern states.

Disease Prevalence
Top 3 diseases reported: Cholera (28,589 cases), Diarrhea (28,550), and Rubella Mars (28,539).

Waterborne diseases are a major public health concern.

Diseases like Marburg Virus and Viral Hemorrhagic Fever hint at zoonotic threats tied to environmental hygiene and wildlife contact.

Gender & Age Group
Females were more affected (147,272) than males (137,212), possibly due to societal or healthcare access factors.

The 1–20 age group is the most affected (93,865 cases), followed by 21–40 years (70,934), suggesting increased exposure in youth due to environmental or immunity factors.

Trends Over the Years
Disease cases fluctuated, peaking in 2013 (28,745 cases) and 2016 (28,638).

Indicates periodic outbreaks, potentially influenced by seasonal changes, natural disasters, or health system readiness.

Patient Survival Analysis
Nearly equal number of deaths (142,289) and recoveries (142,195).

High mortality may reflect late detection, inadequate healthcare, or poor disease management.

Final Observations Summary
Geographic Concentration: States like Niger and Ondo need urgent intervention.

Waterborne Disease Risk: Focus on clean water and sanitation.

Zoonotic Concerns: Raise awareness on animal-to-human disease transmission.

Youth at Risk: School-based health programs and youth-targeted campaigns are crucial.

Gender Disparities: Explore socio-health barriers impacting women.

Trend Cycles: Prepare for outbreaks in peak years through forecasting models.

Not Region-Specific: Invest uniformly across all regions, focusing on vulnerable states.

High Mortality: Improve diagnosis speed and treatment accessibility.

Age-specific Interventions: Design age-targeted healthcare responses.

About the Dataset
This dataset was cleaned and analyzed as part of a simulation project under the Vephla University learning program, using realistic patterns to reflect public health conditions across Nigeria.

Recommendations
Improve sanitation infrastructure to reduce waterborne disease transmission.

Strengthen state health systems, especially in high-outbreak states.

Develop age- and gender-specific intervention programs.

Invest in outbreak early warning systems and seasonal preparedness.

Public health education on hygiene, disease symptoms, and prevention.
